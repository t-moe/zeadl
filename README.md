##Navigation:
The App starts at the main view, we call it channel overview. At this place, you can add and remove several data channels, by typing "Select Groups" in the menu (on the top-right side), where you can simply add (checked) or remove (unchecked) the signal channels.
Notice: You handle the Sensor Groups, which are determined by the genius developer team ;) More Info at "Channel Info".
